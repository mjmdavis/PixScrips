PixScripts
==========

The idea is to build a repository of useful scripts for Pixelmator. Since they
do not officially support scripting, the scripts can be tricky to write and
maintain. I am hoping that the task will not fall solely upon me.

Using UIBrowser and UIElementInspector it is possible to navigate the ui and
press the buttons.

Available Scripts
-----------------

*   pixelmator_export_sizes.scpt
    *   This script will scale the last focused image to all the sizes defined in imgSizes in the script
    and export them as PNG to the last used folder.
